synopsis: "A trustworthy parser for POSIX shell"
description: """
Morbig is a parser for shell scripts written in the POSIX shell script
language. It parses the scripts statically, that is without executing
them, and constructs a concrete syntax tree for each of them. The
concrete syntax trees are built using constructors according to the
shell grammar of the POSIX standard.

(*specification:

If an open bracket introduces a bracket expression as in XBD RE
   Bracket Expression, except that the <exclamation-mark> character (
   '!' ) shall replace the <circumflex> character ( '^' ) in its role
   in a non-matching list in the regular expression notation, it shall
   introduce a pattern bracket expression. A bracket expression
   starting with an unquoted <circumflex> character produces
   unspecified results. Otherwise, '[' shall match the character
   itself.

## The goal of this script is to copy the type definitions of the module CST and
## to add code to it. Typically, this code will be obtained using [@@deriving]
## annotations to produce serializers or visitors.
##
## In an ideal world, this could be done fully in OCaml using ppx_import. This
## PPX seems however not to be maintained so much anymore. It also clashes with
## the ocaml-migrate-parsetree way to write PPXes, which is used both in
## ppx_deriving and visitors, which we use. In lack of a better solution, Shell
## comes to the rescue!

set -euC

## The first argument of this script represents the kind of file which we want
## to produce. For now, this script only supports "serializers" and "visitors".
## For each of these kinds, we define two strings which will be put after the
## introduction or after the CST. Typically, these strings will contain
## [@@deriving] annotations in order to produce extra code from the types in the
## CST file.

## The following sed recognizes anything of the form:

##     type foo = bar = ...
##     and foo = ...
##     and foo = bar = ...

## and replaces them with:

##     type foo = $1.foo = ...
##     and foo = $1.foo = ...
##     and foo = $1.foo = ...

## where $1 is the first argument, except when what follows the equal sign
## starts with a lowercase, because this would then be a syntax equality and we
## must not add an other one. This function is useful to copy a whole type while
## keeping it equal with the original module's type.

## Here, we copy the type CST, we rewrite all the type definitions to add a type
## equality with the CST and then we replace the placeholders by their contents.

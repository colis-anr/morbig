(*specification

  A "tilde-prefix" consists of an unquoted <tilde> character at the
   beginning of a word, followed by all of the characters preceding
   the first unquoted <slash> in the word, or all the characters in
   the word if there is no <slash>. In an assignment (see XBD Variable
   Assignment), multiple tilde-prefixes can be used: at the beginning
   of the word (that is, following the <equals-sign> of the
   assignment), following any unquoted <colon>, or both. A
   tilde-prefix in an assignment is terminated by the first unquoted
   <colon> or <slash>. If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix
   are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the
   <tilde> are treated as a possible login name from the user
   database. A portable login name cannot contain characters outside
   the set given in the description of the LOGNAME environment
   variable in XBD Other Environment Variables. If the login name is
   null (that is, the tilde-prefix contains only the tilde), the
   tilde-prefix is replaced by the value of the variable HOME. If HOME
   is unset, the results are unspecified. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix
   shall be replaced by a pathname of the initial working directory
   associated with the login name obtained using the getpwnam()
   function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of
   POSIX.1-2017. If the system does not recognize the login name, the
   results are undefined.

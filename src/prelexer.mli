   This module implements the token recognizer when it is not in the mode
   that recognizes here-documents, and in cases where the recognition of
   tokens is independent from the parsing context, as specified by:

              2.3 Token Recognition

(** [token b l] advances in the lexbuf [l], and produces a list of
    pretokens from [l], using a queue of symbols in the buffer [b] *)
val token :
  PrelexerState.t ->
  Lexing.lexbuf ->
  (Pretoken.t * Lexing.position * Lexing.position) list

(** [single_quotes b l] advances in the lexing buffer [l] to
    recognize a word between single quotes. This is used by
    here-document recognition. *)
val single_quotes :
  Buffer.t -> PrelexerState.t -> Lexing.lexbuf -> PrelexerState.t

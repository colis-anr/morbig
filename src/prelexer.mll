(*specification:

   When it is not processing an io_here, the shell shall break its
   input into tokens by applying the first applicable rule below to the
   next character in its input. The token shall be from the current
   position in the input until a token is delimited according to one of
   the rules below; the characters forming the token are exactly those in
   the input, including any quoting characters. If it is indicated that a
   token is delimited, and no characters have been included in a token,
   processing shall continue until an actual token is delimited.

*)

(**

   The lexing rule [token] is parameterized by [current] of type
   [PrelexerState.t] which represents the state of the lexical
   engine.

   As described in [PrelexerState], the state of the pretokenizer
   contains contextual information. More precisely, the lexical
   analysis needs to know:

   - the "nesting context", roughly speaking, is the imbrication
     of double-quotes and backquotes in the whole input (in particular,
     it includes the nesting context of parent parsers, i.e. parsers
     that recursively called the current instance for subshell parsing) ;

   - the "lexing context" is a state that constraints lexical rules
     (for instance, being on the right-hand-side of an <equal> character
     may lead to the production of an assignment word, while other
     context may not) ;

   - the "buffer" is a sequence of input items that are still to be
     included in a pretoken.

(** Quotations *)

(*specification:

   If the current character is <backslash>, single-quote, or
   double-quote and it is not quoted, it shall affect quoting for
   subsequent characters up to the end of the quoted text. The rules for
   quoting are as described in Quoting. During token recognition no
   substitutions shall be actually performed, and the result token shall
   contain exactly the characters that appear in the input (except for
   <newline> joining), unmodified, including any embedded or enclosing
   quotes or substitution operators, between the <quotation-mark> and the
   end of the quoted text. The token shall not be delimited by the end of
   the quoted field.

(*specification:

   2.2.1 Escape Character (Backslash)

   A <backslash> that is not quoted shall preserve the literal value of
   the following character, with the exception of a <newline>. If a
   <newline> follows the <backslash>, the shell shall interpret this as
   line continuation. The <backslash> and <newline> shall be removed
   before splitting the input into tokens. Since the escaped <newline> is
   removed entirely from the input and is not replaced by any white
   space, it cannot serve as a token separator.
